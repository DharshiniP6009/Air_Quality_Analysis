# 🌫️ Air Quality Analysis with Python

This project provides a simple yet structured way to analyze air quality data using Python and the popular pandas library. The main objective is to help understand patterns in pollution levels using a real-world dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📊 Dataset Information

We are working with the **AirQualityUCI.csv** dataset, which contains measurements of air pollutants collected in an Italian city between March 2004 and February 2005.

### ✅ Features include:
- CO(GT) — Carbon Monoxide concentration
- PT08.S1, PT08.S2, etc. — Sensor responses
- NMHC(GT), C6H6(GT), NOx(GT), NO2(GT) — Various chemical readings
- Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Absolute Humidity
- Date and Time

📌 **Note:** The dataset uses a semicolon (`;`) as a separator and includes some missing values, marked as `-200`.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

This project includes the following tasks:

1. **File Upload and Reading**
   - Upload the CSV file to the notebook.
   - Load the file using `pandas` with proper handling of delimiters and errors.

2. **Error Handling**
   - Gracefully handle missing files, incorrect formats, and general loading issues.

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Preview the dataset with `df.head()`.
   - Identify any data quality issues (like missing or malformed values).

4. *(Optional)*: Further steps may include:
   - Data cleaning (handling missing values)
   - Data visualization (e.g., trends over time)
   - Correlation analysis between pollutants and weather factors

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine or in Google Colab.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-analysis.git
cd air-quality-analysis

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install required Python packages

pip install -r requirements.txt


▶️ Running the Project:

Google Colab
Upload the notebook to Colab.

Use the file upload cell to load AirQualityUCI.csv from your local machine.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3

pandas

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

💡 Notes
Make sure to use the correct delimiter (sep=';') when reading the CSV file.

Always check the dataset for missing or invalid values before analysis.

This is a good starting point for more advanced analysis or machine learning on air quality data.
